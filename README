ForceDirected
=============

Program released under the GPLv3 license to calculate graph node positions
based on Hooke Attraction's Law and Coulomb Repultion's Law. User can specify
the size of the spring used in the experiment, and the amount of positive
charge for each particle. The damping parameter helps the algorithm to stop,
otherwise it will run forever.
